Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Project:
            
                                                    Result Assistant
                                                    
             After learning the basics of OOP, I made this project to implement the ideas. 
             In this project I use 
             Android Studio to make a android app named Result Assistant.
             The app helps a student to calculate the minimum number, s/he needs to get to obtain A+ in the final exam in that course. 
             The app will give it's assistance considering the credit hour of the course,
             best 3 quiz marks, attendance mark and mid semester exam mark.
